        <p>
        Hi there, I'm Miller! I switched my gears from my career in medicince to dive into Web Development. 
        Web Development has interested me since I was in college, but I never took the leap to really get into it until recently. I soon found that the technologial field suits me far better than the medical field and decided to start pursing a career in coding!
        I always believed that anything can be improved and 
        there are different ways to solve problems.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        I am Full Stack Web Developer based in Charlotte, NC with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Biology. I also posses Emergency Medical Transport, First-Aid/CPR, and Basic Life Support Certifications.
        I am incredibly organized and hard working. I'm a naturally bubbly person and always put my all into everything that I do.
